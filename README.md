## What is it

cozy-twakecalendar is a container app that embeds [Twake Calendar](https://github.com/linagora/twake-calendar-frontend) app. It is a very basic app displaying the cozy-bar and an iframe. By leveraging [cozy-external-bridge-container](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-external-bridge-container), it allows history syncing from Twake Calendar and exposes APIs to Twake Calendar.
